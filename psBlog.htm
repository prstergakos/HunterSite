		<p>I have been in sales for many years and have always been interested in technology. Always thought programming was interesting and my interest increased when working with a software company. I was looking to make a jump from sales and get involved in programming and came accross the hunter program. The onboarding process was easy and everyone was very helpful and eager to get you started. I am now 5 months in an have learned an unbelievable amount of information. I understand there is a long way still to go and I will never know everything, but I feel confident that I will be prepared to enter the field and be successful. I am very much looking forward to my externship and obtaining more hands on experience in addition to making connections in the industry. We Still have a few monhts to go and more to learn but it is an exciting time and I look forward to the challenges ahead. </p>
