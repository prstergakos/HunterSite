						<h3>PAST</h3>
						<p>I attended the Univeristy of Hartford and graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Marketing and Buiness Administration. After Graduation I worked as an underwritter for an Automated Clearing House, where I would process payments for business establishments all over the country. During my time there I developed a taste for finance, started working at an investment firm, and began to pursue my Series 7 and 63. I was able to become a fully licensed broker by the end of that year and continued as a junior broker for the next several years. I was successful during my time in finance, but I grew tired of the early mornings and late nights, and decided to purue a role with a dental supply company. After I became bored with the dental industry, I decided to pursue a career in the technology field. I obtained a position with a Point-of-Sale hardware company. I worked with Bematech for two years and was approached by CA Technologies and started with them not long after. I was part of the Project and Portfolio Management Team. During the year I was there, I learned a lot about software, and realized that technology really piqued my interest. Being in sales for 10 plus years has given me much experience, but I want to pursue something new so here I am.</p>

							<h3>PRESENT</h3>
							<p>I was recently married this past August and I'm expecting my first child in October. We are having a baby girl and my wife and I couldn't be more excited. I am currently working part time from home for a friend of mine while attending the Hunter course. Right now I am focused on taking in as much information as possible, in and out of the classroom, because I know that things are constantly changing and continuing my education is very important.</p>

							<h3>FUTURE</h3>
							<p>I'm really looking forward to my externship, and hope to be a contributing member of the team right away. I understand that I still have a long way to go, and will have a lot of learning to do on the job as well, but I feel confident I will be able to handle anything that comes my way. My future is bright and I feel that with programming knowlege I will have many different avenues I can pursue.</p>
